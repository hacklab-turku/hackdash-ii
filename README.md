# Hackdash II

### To build:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn build
```

The output is in `public/`

### How to use

You need a Matrix account that is a member of the Turku Hacklab room (#turku:hacklab.fi). When you open the app you will be asked to login to that Matrix account. To logout, you need to clear the browser site data for the app, because there's no logout button anywhere (sorry).
